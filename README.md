This project develops a logistic regression model to predict advertisement click-through rates (CTR) based on a dataset of 13 million entries, 
focusing on advanced feature engineering and encoding techniques to optimize predictions. 
By minimizing log loss and enhancing targeting precision, the model empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions for more effective digital marketing campaigns.
